## Covariate Assisted Spectral Clustering (CASC)

This repository contains the scripts used for the simulations and the brain graph data analysis in the Covariate Assisted Spectral Clustering paper.

- brainGraphAnalysis: contains the scripts for clustering brain graphs and analyzing the results
- code: contains R scripts implementing CASC and other methods as well as a bunch of useful helper functions
- simulations: contains the scripts for running the simulations and plotting the results
